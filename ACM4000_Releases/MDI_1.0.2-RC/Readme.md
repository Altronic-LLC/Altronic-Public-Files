# Latestest 1.0.2 Release Candidate #
[MDI 1.0.2-RC1 Release](https://github.com/Altronic-LLC/Altronic-Public-Files/blob/main/ACM4000_Releases/MDI_1.0.2-RC/mdi-1.0.2-RC1.atf)

**Note:** When installing this on the system, change the name of this file to 1.0.2.atf. Otherwise, the system will not recognize the update file. This issue has been fixed in this release.

**Changelog:**
- Fixed an issue where if DE-4000 Timezone was not 0 or the default, it would cause the system storage to fill up (similar to the browser refresh issue on the DE-4000).
- Fixed an issue where the update process did not recognize an mdi-X.X.X-RCX file and would only recognize mdi-1.0.1.
