## Release Kind: Final Release

## Intended Use and Users

Latest Production Release.

### Changelog:

#### Versioning:
- **FUXA:** 1.0.0
- **Expanded Comms:** 1.0.0
- **eRCM:** 1.0.0
- **MDI:** 1.1.13

#### Quality of Life Changes:
- **Package Management:** Added the ability to view versions of FUXA, Expanded Comms, and ACI Server packages in the ACM.
- **USB Update Naming:** Renamed USB update to mdi-acm-core-X.X.X and added support for update files that start with both `mdi-` and `acm-` prefixes.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Starting with future releases, USB update packages will use the new naming convention: `acm-core-X.X.X` instead of `mdi-X.X.X`. This change reflects the expanded scope of the ACM platform beyond just the MDI interface - with the integration of FUXA, Expanded Communications, and ACI Server packages, the system now encompasses a comprehensive control and monitoring solution where the MDI is just one component of the broader ACM ecosystem. The current `mdi-acm-core-1.0.0` naming is used only for this transitional version since we added the ability to identify files using the `acm-` prefix in this release.
- **Cursor Display:** Modified the startup script to allow cursor to be shown when connected to the ACM with a mouse.
- **Network Configuration:** Modified the Client Mode Network to use nmcli instead of wpa_supplicant for improved reliability.
- **Serial Port Path:** Modified path for RS485 ports due to an intermittant issue where serial ports would sometimes disconnect and reconnect.

#### Bug Fixes:
- **Temperature Watchdog:** Removed software watchdog from MDI-Gateway which caused a reboot cycle when above 90¬∞C CM4 temperature.
- **TCP Server Float32:** Fixed an issue with the slave TCP server in the MDI-Gateway which caused float32 registers to only return 16 bits.
- **Ethernet Hotplug:** Allowed ethernet ports to hotplug when in a bridge due to an issue where if an ethernet port disconnects and reconnects it did not rejoin the bridge.

#### New Features:
- **FUXA Integration:** Added FUXA Debian package which installs FUXA on the ACM when using an ACM with more than 8GB of storage.
- **Expanded Communications:** Added Expanded Comms Debian package which installs enhanced communication capabilities on the ACM when using an ACM with more than 8GB of storage.
- **eRCM:** Added eRCM Debian packages which installs the ACI kernel and hosts a HTTP Server at port 8088 and a TCP server at port 503.

> **üìã Note:** All new features listed above are only available on ACM-4000 devices equipped with CM4 modules that have more than 8GB of storage capacity.
