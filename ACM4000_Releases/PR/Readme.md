## **What is a Pre-Release Candidate (PR)?**
A **Pre-Release Candidate (PR)** version is an early release of software intended for internal testing and evaluation. These versions are not final and may contain bugs or incomplete features. They are distributed for testing purposes and are not to be used for production environments or field deployment.

### Key Characteristics of PR Versions:
- Tagged with `-PR` in the version number (e.g., `1.0.0-PR`).
- Used for internal evaluation, testing, and feedback.
- Not validated for deployment on production systems.
- Publicly available in the **PR folder** of the repository for transparency and testing.

## **Instructions for PR Usage**
- **Testing Focus:** PR versions should be thoroughly tested in controlled environments before proceeding to the **Release Candidate (RC)** stage.
- **Feedback Loop:** Any issues found during testing should be logged and addressed before moving forward.
