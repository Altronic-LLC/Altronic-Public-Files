## Release Kind: Final Release

## Intended Use and Users

Latest Production Release.

### Changelog:

#### Versioning:
- **FUXA:** 1.0.0
- **Expanded Comms:** 1.0.0
- **eRCM:** 1.0.0
- **MDI:** 1.1.13

#### Quality of Life Changes:
- **Package Management:** Added the ability to view versions of FUXA, Expanded Comms, and ACI Server packages in the ACM.
- **USB Update Naming:** Renamed USB update to mdi-acm-core-X.X.X and added support for update files that start with both `mdi-` and `acm-` prefixes.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Starting with future releases, USB update packages will use the new naming convention: `acm-core-X.X.X` instead of `mdi-X.X.X`. This change reflects the expanded scope of the ACM platform beyond just the MDI interface - with the integration of FUXA, Expanded Communications, and ACI Server packages, the system now encompasses a comprehensive control and monitoring solution where the MDI is just one component of the broader ACM ecosystem. The current `mdi-acm-core-1.0.0` naming is used only for this transitional version since we added the ability to identify files using the `acm-` prefix in this release.
- **Cursor Display:** Modified the startup script to allow cursor to be shown when connected to the ACM with a mouse.
- **Network Configuration:** Modified the Client Mode Network to use nmcli instead of wpa_supplicant for improved reliability.
- **Serial Port Path:** Modified path for RS485 ports due to an intermittant issue where serial ports would sometimes disconnect and reconnect.

#### Bug Fixes:
- **Temperature Watchdog:** Removed software watchdog from MDI-Gateway which caused a reboot cycle when above 90¬∞C CM4 temperature.
- **TCP Server Float32:** Fixed an issue with the slave TCP server in the MDI-Gateway which caused float32 registers to only return 16 bits.
- **Ethernet Hotplug:** Allowed ethernet ports to hotplug when in a bridge due to an issue where if an ethernet port disconnects and reconnects it did not rejoin the bridge.

#### New Features:
- **FUXA Integration:** Added FUXA Debian package which installs FUXA on the ACM when using an ACM with more than 8GB of storage.
- **Expanded Communications:** Added Expanded Comms Debian package which installs enhanced communication capabilities on the ACM when using an ACM with more than 8GB of storage.
- **eRCM:** Added eRCM Debian packages which installs the ACI kernel and hosts a HTTP Server at port 8088 and a TCP server at port 503.

> **üìã Note:** All new features listed above are only available on ACM-4000 devices equipped with CM4 modules that have more than 8GB of storage capacity.

## [MDI 1.0.2 Firmware Release](https://github.com/Altronic-LLC/Altronic-Public-Files/blob/main/ACM4000_Releases/Final/1.0.2/mdi-1.0.2.atf)

  ### Fixes:
  - **TCP (RC7):** Fixed an issue where the port 502 override for TCP devices did not save properly.
  - **Trending (RC6):** Fixed an issue where if the labels are very large, the dropdown would wrap to the next line hiding certain buttons on the DE-4000.
  - **UI Layout (RC5):** Fixed an issue where the hamburger button would not scale properly with the DE-4000 on certain resolutions like the 8" TruVu.
  - **Networking (RC5):** Fixed an issue when updating the main device to wait for nginx server to restart.
  - **Datalogging (RC4):** Fixed an issue where Influx would not datalog registers with labels that contain certain characters like `, )` etc.
  - **TCP (RC4):** Fixed an issue where the PLC+ devices' TCP connection would not be closed upon IP change and importing a new config.
  - **Import Config (RC4):** Fixed an issue where the import config would sometimes cause the file containing the ethernet config to write values twice, causing that port to have no IP address.
  - **Trending Updates (RC2):** Resolved an issue where trending data would not update while connected via Ethernet unless the page was refreshed or reopened.
  - **UI Layout (RC2):** Corrected an issue where the overlay and stack buttons on the trending screen occasionally wrapped to the next line.
  - **Nginx Configuration (RC2):** Fixed an issue where the Nginx config would not update during installation but would update on first provision.
  - **Push Config (RC2):** Fixed an issue where the push config would be overridden on the HMI when first pulling data.
  - **CSV Export (RC2):** Fixed an issue where labels for the full export were not appearing at the top of the CSV file.
  - **Trending Lag (RC2):** Fixed an issue where trending seemed to lag for a second or two during batch writes to the database. Data now writes immediately.
  - **Update Process (RC1):** Fixed an issue where the update process did not recognize an `mdi-X.X.X-RCX` file and would only recognize `mdi-1.0.1`.
  - **Timezone (RC1):** Fixed an issue where if DE-4000 Timezone was not 0 or the default, it would cause the system storage to fill up (similar to the browser refresh issue on the DE-4000).

  ### Quality of Life (QOL) Improvements:
  - **Trending (RC7):** Added Chart type(Stacked or Overlay) to be stored in config. The last chart type is remembered when selecting charts.
  - **Main Device (RC6):** Added Main device refresh message if device is not connected for any reason.
  - **Networking (RC6):** Added Static IP Address to the Ethernet Settings.
  - **Main Device (RC6):** Added a Message for the device if there are no ethernet ports specified in the same subnet as the device's IP Address.
  - **Gateway Logs (RC4):** Removed some non-required logging to improve performance and storage.
  - **Operating System (RC3):** Removed Linux boot up command line text when powering the unit.
  - **SD Card Safeguards (RC2):** Added additional safeguards to protect against SD card corruption.
  - **Device Naming (RC2):** Modified the device name in InfluxDB to use unique names without relying on unique IDs. Device names will now auto-increment if needed. Note: This change will automatically update charts on the HMI, but charts stored in your browser will need manual updates.
  - **Time Synchronization:** Fixed an issue where the ACM-4000 would not update its time with the DE-4000

  ### New Features:
  - **Screen Sleep Timer (RC5):** Added the ability to set a timer for the HMI to go to sleep in minutes. 0 will set this to never go to sleep.
  - **Chart Naming (RC2):** Added the ability to name charts directly on the trending screen.
