Description: Rod Load Ariel
    Copy entire code to the bottom of MASTER script. The default program is set up for 5 stage.
    If you need only 3 stages, you first go into the first section of the "if not Rod_Load_FS", and 
    delete the create_param section of the stages not needed. The second step is go to the bottom
    of the rod load code and remove the function call Rodload(x) of the stages not being used. After 
    those two steps are completed, the Ariel Rod Load is setup in script. The user then would need to save This
    script into the MASTER script, and set up the user parameters, from the "HMI" "PARAMS" section for the inputs 
    and constant variables needed for the calculations to execute correctly
    * Each Stage must have an input for the following
        - Suction Pressure
        - Suction Temperature
        - Discharge Pressure
        - Discharge Temperature
