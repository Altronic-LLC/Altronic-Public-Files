Standard O2 input version

Added running counter that counts from 0-10000 repeatedly (Register 30045) for making sure the modbus is working. 
Added register 40017 and 40517 for changing the threshold of thermocouple 1 for when the AFR-500 starts controlling. Default is 650 degrees F and allowed range is 200 to 1500 degrees F.
IP address can now be changed through modbus. 
Proportional gain is 10 times higher than Rev 2.3. 
Changed step sequence of stepper motor to not lose steps.
Grounding Digital Input 3 will now cause an F1 start to reset the stepper and go to the default position. Now allows F1 start when temperature > threshold register (400017, 405017).
 
Fixed modbus writes to 00000's crashing micro.

Added ability to change modbus baud rate (register 40232). Values are 0 = 2400 baud, 1 = 4800 baud, 2 = 9600 baud, 3 = 19200 baud, 4 = 38400 baud, 5 = 115200 baud






analog in version 

Firmware for analog input 4 to be used as a control input instead of O2.
