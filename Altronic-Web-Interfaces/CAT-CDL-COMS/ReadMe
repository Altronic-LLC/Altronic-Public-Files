# Altronic Web Interface (AWI) Dashboards – CAT Engine CDL Communications

## Overview
This repository contains the **Altronic standard, tested, and released AWI dashboards** used for **CAT engine CDL communications**.  
These dashboards are designed and validated by Altronic engineering to ensure compatibility, performance, and reliability across supported engine types.

Each dashboard file corresponds to a specific CAT engine configuration and has been tested for proper data polling and visualization within the Altronic Web Interface.

## Dashboard Variants

### 1. **Standard Dashboards (e.g., `3616A3 v0`)**
These dashboards poll **all available data registers**, including those not displayed on the dashboard and those potentially not relevant to that engine.  
This approach ensures comprehensive data acquisition but may result in **slightly slower polling rates** due to the larger number of registers requested.

**Use case:**  
For engineers or users who require complete data coverage — including less frequently used or diagnostic registers.

---

### 2. **DBO (Dashboard Only) Dashboards (e.g., `3616A3_DBO v0`)**
**DBO** stands for **Dashboard Only**.  
These dashboards poll **only the registers displayed on the dashboard**, which results in **faster data updates** due to reduced polling load.

**Use case:**  
For applications prioritizing **speed and responsiveness** where only key operational data (visible on the dashboard) is needed.

## Naming Convention
Each dashboard file follows the naming format:

```
[EngineModel]_[Variant] v[Revision]
```

Examples:
- `3616A3 v0` – Standard AWI Dashboard for CAT 3616A3 Engine  
- `3616A3_DBO v0` – Dashboard Only version for CAT 3616A3 Engine  
- `3512_ULB_DBO vR0` – Dashboard Only version for CAT 3512 ULB Engine (Revision R0)
