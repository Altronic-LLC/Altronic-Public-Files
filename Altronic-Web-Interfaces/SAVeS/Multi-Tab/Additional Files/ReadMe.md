# AWI Files - SAVeS

## Overview  
This directory contains the additional **Altronic Web Interface (AWI)** dashboards and configuration files for **Smart Altronic Vibration Sensor (SAVeS) Multi-Tab AWI**.
These files have been tested and validated by Altronic engineering to ensure proper communication, performance, and compatibility with supported Altronic systems.

The **SAVeS Multi-Tab AWI** introduces a new interface design that consolidates multiple vibration sensor dashboards into a single, unified AWI file.
Instead of multiple individual AWI tabs for each vibration device, the Multi-Tab interface provides a single AWI entry point with multiple navigation buttons inside — allowing quick access to each vibration sensor’s data under one organized layout.

This design improves usability, reduces clutter, and provides a more cohesive view of vibration data across all monitored devices.

This is an advanced feature set if the ACM-4000's AWI capability and the manual for setup and operation is available on the Altronic website.

## ⚠️ Naming Convention  
- The filenames in this repository are pre-named to work with the SAVeS_MultiTab AWI.
- ⚠️ **Important:** If you wish to use the SAVeS_MultiTab AWI as is, all additional AWIs must remain the same name when they are loaded.

## How to Use  
1. Download the appropriate dashboard or configuration file for your system.  
2. Load the file into your **ACM-4000**.  
3. Confirm communication settings (IP address, protocol, node ID, polling rate) match your setup.  
4. Refer to any additional documentation or instructions in this folder for configuration details.
