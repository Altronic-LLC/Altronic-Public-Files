Section 10 Updating software
Two versions of the ST firmware exist. 1.4.X and 2.x.x. The 1.4 versions are for when legacy only modules existed
and has only been maintained up to critical bug fixes for anyone not moving to the 2.x.x firmware.
2.x.x offers some additional features and the capability for NGI-5000 full system functionality. 

Firmware update 20250425 Promoting from RC to final
Version 2.0.2
- Only to be used with 2.0.3 and later CM4
- ST micro firmware change for allowing Logic Module to go into firing state when in Legacy Mode and advanced feature bank cut-off is active.
	- There was an issue in the field that the Logic Module would not go into firing state when in Legacy Mode and 
	the miscellaneous input was used for bank cut-off. The logic module would stay in the “Trying” state.

Firmware update 20250214 Promoting from RC to final
Version 2.0.1
- -Only to be used with 2.0.3 and later CM4
- Attempt to fix the missing reset output and a missing firing cycle (except the last firing) by not clearing the flags of a timer interrupt. 
- Because of the extra firing that would occur, this also attempts to fix the alarm "NO DISCHARGE" on a cylinder that is non-existent or past the firing pattern.

Firmware update 20240920
Version 2.0.0

-Only to be used with 2.0.3 and later CM4
- Added second plug-cut-out options from engine-config-tool.
Option 1: second plug cutout feature not enabled.
Option 2: Active when RPM > 200
Option 3: Active when miscellaneous input is grounded
Register 10010 indicates whether second plug cut-out is active/would be active if firing.
-EEPROM continuous writing issue was resolved. Note: after installing this version, 
the default settings will be loaded in place of the configured settings. Before updating,
 make note of the configured settings, so that they can be manually entered again after updating the firmware.


Firmware update 8-5-2024
